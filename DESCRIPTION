Description: The Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M) was developed from the
    Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS) approach used in biodiversity species
    counting and adapted for use in health and nutrition surveys by Brixton Health
    and Valid International. S3M is used in surveys designed to be spatially 
    representative i.e., the sample distributed evenly across the survey area, 
    using a spatial sample design that selected communities located closest to 
    the centroids of a hexagonal grid laid over the survey area. The resulting 
    sample is a triangular irregular network.
