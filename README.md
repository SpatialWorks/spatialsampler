The Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS) and the Simple Spatial
Survey Method (S3M) are spatial sampling methods adapted and used in
health and nutrition surveys by Brixton Health and Valid International.
CSAS and S3M are used in surveys designed to be spatially representative
i.e., the sample distributed evenly across the survey area, using a
spatial sample design that selected communities located closest to the
centroids of a square (for CSAS) or hexagonal (for S3M) grid laid over
the survey area.

The `spatialsampler` package provides sets of functions for implementing
the Centric Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS) and Simple Spatial Sampling
Method (S3M) using R.

## Installation

You can install `spatialsampler` from GitHub with:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("validmeasures/spatialsampler")
library(spatialsampler)
```

## Usage

The current functions in `spatialsampler` can be grouped into two (2)
classes: *calculator* functions and *sampling* functions.

The *calculator* functions support the estimation of spatial sampling
parameters needed for CSAS and S3M. These include the calculation of
areas of grids, calculation of `d` value in kilometres that the grid
area represents, calculation of height and length of rectangular grid
for S3M and calculation of number of grids given the sampling area and d
value or area size of grids.

The *sampling* functions support the implementation of the CSAS or S3M
sampling.

### Calculator functions

1.  `calculate_area()`

Calculates the area size of the resulting hexagon in a hexagonal grid
and the area size of the resulting triangle in a triangular grid for a
specified value of `d` (in kms) used in the simple spatial sampling
method (S3M).

Given a \(d\) of 10 kms, area can be calculated as follows:

``` r
calculate_area(d = 10, digits = 2)
#>        tri      hex
#> 1 129.9038 259.8076
```

The result is a data frame of 1 row and 2 columns. The first column
gives the area of the triangular grid (in kms) and the second column
gives the area of the hexagonal grid (in kms).

### Sampling functions

1.  Create a hexagonal sampling grid based on a d of 15 kms

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#
# Subset Sudan map to Sennar state map
#
sennar <- subset(sudan01, STATE == "Sennar")
#
# Create sampling grid
#
samp.points <- create_sp_grid(x = sennar, 
                              d = 15, 
                              buffer = 10, 
                              country = "Sudan")
```

`create_sp_grid()` creates

``` r
hex.samp    <- sp::HexPoints2SpatialPolygons(samp.points)
villages.sp <- get_nearest_point(data = sennar_villages, 
                                 data.x = "x", 
                                 data.y = "y", 
                                 query = samp.points, 
                                 duplicate = FALSE)
```
